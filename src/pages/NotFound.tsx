      <p>
        Looks like the chatbot you were looking for has gone rogue and escaped
        from our lab. Don't worry, our team of highly trained AI experts are on
        the case and are working tirelessly to catch it and bring it back. In
        the meantime, why not try chatting with one of our other chatbots? They
        promise to behave and stay within their designated areas. Thank you for
        your understanding and patience.
